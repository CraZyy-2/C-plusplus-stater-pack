# C++
C++ (or “C plus plus”) is a generic programming language for building software. It is an object-oriented language. In other words, it emphasizes using data fields with unique attributes (also known as objects) rather than relying on logic or functions. A common example of an object is a user account on a website. A user account typically contains closely related data like a first name, last name, and email address. Bundling that information together into an object makes it easy to replicate the process of creating a new online account.
